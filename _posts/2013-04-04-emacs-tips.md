Emacs is a very powerful editor. As the emacs manual puts it, it is an **advanced, self-documenting, customizable, extensible** editor. I will also use this blog to dump all the interesting/useful key bindings and features that I find as a reminder to myself and to others

| Key   | function                | What it does                      |
|-------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| M-m   | back-to-indentation     | Move to first non-whitespace char |
| M-SPC | just-one-space          | Retain just one space             |
| M-\   | delete-horizontal-space | Remove all spaces around point    |

Hopefully these aren't among those that you already knew.
