I know I am not the first person to recommend you this. I don't even believe I will be among the first million people to make this recommendation. It's still worth pointing out the importance of being comfortable with at least one good editor.  "Why", you may ask, "should I spend I time learning a editor rather than implementing my favorite missing feature in my favorite project?". The short answer is it *increases focus and productivity*; the long answer is the rest of the blog post.

Let us assume you love coding and do around eight hours of solid coding everyday, which involves both moving through various parts of different files and editing files. Both require a good deal of editor usage for moving across files and editing fiels. If you assume that your editor gives you 10% increase in efficiency then you save approximately then you will save a few minutes daily which will accumulate over a period of time and will save you weeks...

You don't buy into the argument? Neither do I. Learning editor, if you are doing it for the first time, is probably one of the most painful things that could happen. You would have gone through a few key combinations or maintain a cheet sheet but your fingers just won't press the right keys. Worse of all may be during the first few weeks your productivity would have gone down by as much as 80% because practicing the weird key combinations distracts us from translating ideas to code.

Now the question is why do so many people recommend learning a editor? Why do we have editor wars? The answer is quite simple. Imagine that you have a weird operating system, say *weirdos* which does not allow you do type your favorite shortcuts; no C-X / C-C / C-V / C-Z. Every time you want to do any of these basic operations you have to depend on your mouse and use menus; after all some developer has taken the time to implement those menus, so it only makes sense to use the feature. Will it be possible to be productive with that kind of set up? Probably not. The reason is not because of the productivity loss incurred in moving the mouse over the menu and selecting the right options. It is because using a mouse would *feel* intrusive; our flow of thoughts get broken every time we go out of our comfort zone to use a suboptimal solution (mouse in this case). As I said, it is just the feeling that becomes the bigger problem. Force a 3 year old kid to use C-z every time she wants to do a undo while she is painting, she will feel exactly the opposite; for her mouse would be the optimal way to undo.

The deal with being familiar with a editor is also pretty much the same. Typing is nothing more than a essential ceremony to get your thoughts in a file. Considering that, there are both optimal and suboptimal solutions available to do this ceremony. The choices are to either to get constantly distracted by the middle man or be reasonably fluent with the editor and spend uninterrupted time thinking about the idea; the later sounds like a more reasonable choice. If you think you are not getting distracted because of the lack of familiarity towards a editor then I would say you haven't felt the comfort of knowing the territory yet. If you still don't believe me then ask somebody prolific in one editor to switch to something else for a few minutes and watch him struggle.

Learning a new editor (which you know you are going to use) is not as boring as it sounds. It could be an amazing experience. (When I first used text objects in Vim I was blown away, same goes for paredit-mode ). It is also a iterative process because, if you are using a good editor, no matter how many cool things you could do you keep discovering new tricks.

Having said all that which editors should you use? There is no right answer. It totally depends on what you want to do. I work on rails, javascript and clojure a lot and vim/emacs make a lot of sense to me. They also have the added advantages of having support either natively or through plugins for almost any type of file. Your working style would be different so you might like a different editor. The general idea is to pick up the editor which is efficient, extensible and available across platforms that you care about (if you have to work with multiple operating systems).

Hope I have pushed you a little bit further towards learning a editor in this post. So, happy editing!
