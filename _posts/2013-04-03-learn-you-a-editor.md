I know I am not the first person to point this out. Heck, I don't think I will even be among the first million people to point this out! Why, you may ask, should you spend your time learning a editor rather than implementing your favorite missing feature in your favorite application. The short answer is it increases productivity; the long answer is the rest of the blog post.

Say you spend five hours coding, which involves three hours of reading code and two hours of typing. Both require a good deal of editor usage for moving across files and editing fiels. If you assume that your editor gives you 10% increase in efficiency then you save approximately then you will save a few minutes daily which will accumulate over a period of time and will save you weeks...

You don't buy into the argument? Neither do I. Learning editor, if you are doing it for the first time, is probably one of the most painful things that could happen. You would have gone through a few key combinations or maintain a cheet sheet but your fingers just won't press the right keys. Worse of all may be during the first few weeks your productivity would have gone down by as much as 80% because practicing the weird key combinations distracts us from translating ideas to code.

Now the question is why do we have so many people advising the rest to learn a editor? Why do we have editor wars? The answer is quite simple. Imagine that you have a weird operating system, say *weirdos* which does not allow you do type your favorite shortcuts; no C-X / C-C / C-V / C-Z. Every time you want to do any of these basic operations you have to depend on your mouse and use menus; after all some developer has taken the time to implement those menus, so we have to use them. Will it be possible to be productive with that kind of set up? Absolutely not. The reason is not because of the productivity loss incurred in moving the mouse over the menu and selecting the right options, it is that the operation is intrusive; it distracts you from your normal chain of thoughts and it just **gets in the way**. Have you been using those shortcuts since your first introduction to computers? Probably not. Mouse was a perfectly reasonable choice the first few times (years?!) and then we found a faster and less intrusive way of doing things.

The deal with being familiar with a editor is also the same. The editor is a software that stands in the way when you want to dump your ideas in a bunch of files. The choices are to either to get constantly distracted by the middle man or be reasonably fluent with the editor and spend uninterrupted time thinking about the idea; the later sounds like a more reasonable choice. Also learning a new editor (which you know you are going to use) is not as boring as it sounds because you can discover all amazing things you could do there ( like text objects in vim and paredit-mode in emacs ). It is also a iterative process because, if you are using a good editor, no matter how many cool things you could do you keep discovering new tricks.

Having said all that which editors should you use? There is no right answer. It totally depends on what you want to do. I work on rails, javascript and clojure a lot and vim/emacs make a lot of sense to me. They also have the added advantages of having support either natively or through plugins for almost any type of file. Your working style would be different so you might like a different editor. The general idea is to pick up the editor which is efficient, extensible and available across platforms that you care about (if you have to work with multiple operating systems).

Hope I have pushed you a little bit further towards learning a editor in this post. So, happy editing!
